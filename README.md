# gatsby-contentful-netlify-example
A quick example on how to generate a static site with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), using [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a backend, and deploying automatically on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

For an overview of the project please take a look at the companion article [Making a Static Website with Gatsby, Contentful, andÂ Netlify](https://medium.com/@erkkapynnonen/making-a-static-website-with-gatsby-contentful-and-netlify-c7372798fda) on Medium, and dive deeper by reading the [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

*Please note that this repository is a quick, highly unoptimized example for explaining the general idea, and not a production-ready skeleton you should use for bootstrapping your own project. Chances are this repository won't be updated in the future.*
